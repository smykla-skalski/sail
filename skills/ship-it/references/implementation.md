# Implementing and committing the change

Follow repository patterns and implement the smallest complete behavior. Add or extend behavior-focused tests; avoid tests that only mirror implementation details.

Resolve and record the implementation role before the first source edit. Its actual route and execution identity are the baseline for later independence checks.

For GitHub work, verify the checkpoint's claim before the first source edit and renew it at least every 10 minutes while implementing. A failed renewal stops further edits and commits until claim reconciliation succeeds.

Before every commit, run the relevant formatter, linter, type checker, build and tests discovered during exploration. Fix root causes. Never add a lint or type suppression, bypass hooks, or use `--no-verify`.

Keep commits focused and sign them. Commit titles use `<type>(<scope>): <description>`, require a scope, stay within 50 characters and contain no PR reference or AI attribution. Wrap body lines at 72 characters.

Add the source footer when applicable:

| Source                             | Footer                     |
| :--------------------------------- | :------------------------- |
| GitHub issue in this repository    | `Refs #<number>`           |
| GitHub issue in another repository | `Refs owner/repo#<number>` |
| Jira ticket                        | `Refs KEY-123`             |
| Task description                   | no footer                  |

Comply with every commit hook. If a hook changes files, inspect and stage the intended result before committing again.

After every successful commit, create the new revision's evidence record bound to the current GitHub claim when applicable, mark the previous record stale, then atomically update the durable checkpoint with the new `HEAD`, current branch, evidence pointer and next action. Select and report risk before validation. Run every selected local gate against the committed revision and record its result. After implementation gates pass, advance to the first selected downstream gate: `phase: review` for `adversarial-review`, otherwise `phase: test` for `adversarial-test`, otherwise `phase: pr` to validate PR-due evidence and open the PR. Set `nextAction` to that concrete gate or PR action. On a hard stop, preserve the last verified revision and record the blocker; never claim an uncommitted or failed revision as verified checkpoint state.

Before entering review, inspect version bumps across local commits. When the repository expects one bump, squash the unpublished branch now (`git reset --soft "$(git merge-base HEAD origin/<default>)"` then one signed commit with hooks enabled), create evidence for the rewritten `HEAD`, and rerun the quality gates. Review and test always start after the last history rewrite.
