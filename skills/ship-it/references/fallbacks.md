# ship-it fallbacks for other agents

ship-it is written for Claude Code. On Codex, opencode or Copilot CLI, or when a Claude feature is missing, use these fallbacks.

Codex and opencode do not register them; there, or whenever the type is unknown, spawn a generic subagent (`general-purpose`) with the mandate below                                                                                                                                                         |

Copilot CLI: its agent tool. Always one subagent at a time, never in parallel: the Findings Adversary starts only after the Code Adversary returns. No subagent tool: run each pass inline yourself, in order, and reread the source for the refutation pass instead of trusting the first pass |

Codex enforces this through `agents/openai.yaml` (`allow_implicit_invocation: false`). On other agents, start only when the user asked to ship a change or invoked `/ship-it` or `$ship-it`                                                                                                     |

## Sandboxed agents

On agents with a command sandbox (Codex), the user's request to ship the change authorizes normal branch, commit, push, PR, review-reply, merge and issue-close actions in the target repository. If a networked `git`, `gh`, `acli` or `jira` command fails because of the sandbox, rerun it with escalation and a one-line justification. After each state-changing step, inspect the git or GitHub state before continuing.

## Review and test mandates

Use these when the `adversarial-review` or `adversarial-test` skill is not installed. Inputs for every subagent: the repository path, the diff command (`git diff origin/<default>...HEAD`), the changed files, and the task context file.

### Code review (two passes, in order)

1. Code Adversary: spawn `adversarial-review:code-adversary`, or a generic subagent told to assume the change is broken, hunt concrete failures including unmet acceptance criteria, and prove each finding with a failing input, `file:line`, and a fix. Findings are labeled `blocking:`, `issue:` or `question:`.
2. Findings Adversary: spawn a **new** `adversarial-review:findings-adversary`, or a new generic subagent told to refute each finding against the source. Give it the same inputs plus only the numbered findings, never the first agent's reasoning.

The verdict is `NEEDS_FIXES` when any `blocking:` or `issue:` survives the refutation, otherwise `CLEAN`.

### Manual test

Spawn `adversarial-test:test-adversary`, or a generic subagent told to prove the change does not satisfy the task by running the real changed product surface (service + probe, real CLI, sandbox) in isolated temp state, attacking happy paths, boundaries, malformed input, repeated or concurrent use, and adjacent flows, and to report self-contained reproductions. Automated tests, lint, build and grep count only as supporting evidence. Rerun each reproduction yourself before acting on it to drop false failures.

The verdict is `FAIL` when a reproduction survives the rerun, `BLOCKED` when testing needs a human action (name it), otherwise `PASS`.
