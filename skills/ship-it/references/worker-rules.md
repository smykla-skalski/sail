# Ship It worker rules

- Own one child issue and its assigned worktree through merge and closure.
- Read the ship-it entry once and each selected phase reference once. After compaction, read only the checkpoint and current phase reference.
- Never fork coordinator history. Give each gate its mandate once in a fresh context.
- Keep the checkpoint current. Send interim status only when the coordinator asks.
- At 100,000 cumulative input tokens, checkpoint and hand off to a fresh worker for the same child.
- Send one final hand-back with checkpoint path, PR, gated head, merge commit, issue state and blocker or completion result.
