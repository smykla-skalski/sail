description: Fast two-pass adversarial code review. A Code Adversary subagent red-teams a diff or PR to find the concrete bug, then a separate Findings Adversary subagent with a clean context tries to refute every finding to cut false positives. Use for routine changes where a full staff review is overkill, or as the review gate inside ship-it.

# Adversarial Review

## Sail execution rule

Apply the Sail cross-validation policy included with the prompt to both passes. Select only a configured, available agent/model pair, prefer a model different from every implementation model, and honor strict different-model routing. Set and verify the actual provider/model for each fresh session and include them in the verdict. Pause with the reason when no eligible choice exists or model selection cannot be verified. Never substitute outside the selected pool.

Use fresh subagent sessions for both passes, even when the first pass reports no findings. If either session cannot launch, stop and report `Review Verdict: BLOCKED` with the failed pass and reason. Never run a pass inline.

Find the bug, then try to prove the bug report wrong. It answers one question - **is this change correct?** - and answers it hard. It does not evaluate architecture, conventions, dead code, or taste; that is `/staff-code-review`.

Two subagents, opposed, each with a clean context:

1. **Code Adversary** - assumes the change is broken and hunts the concrete failure. Mandate: [references/code-adversary.md](references/code-adversary.md).
2. **Findings Adversary** - assumes the Code Adversary is wrong and tries to refute each finding against the source. Mandate: [references/findings-adversary.md](references/findings-adversary.md).

The second pass exists because an unrefuted adversary nit-bombs. It sees only the first pass's findings, never its reasoning, so it cannot inherit the same misread.

## Agent compatibility

Paths in this file are relative to the skill directory (the one holding this SKILL.md). The workflow is written for Claude Code; on other agents, or when a Claude feature is missing, use these fallbacks:

| Claude Code feature                                                     | Fallback                                                                                                                                                           |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Argument substitution                                                   | If the "Parse from" line under Arguments shows no value or an unreplaced placeholder, take the PR URL, diff file, `--base` and `--context` from the user's request |
| Named agents `adversarial-review:code-adversary` / `findings-adversary` | Spawn a generic subagent with the matching mandate file from `references/` prepended (see [Spawning a clean-context subagent](#spawning-a-clean-context-subagent)) |
| Subagent tool (Agent)                                                   | Codex: `spawn_agent`; opencode: `task`; Copilot CLI: its task/subagent tool. With no subagent tool, report `Review Verdict: BLOCKED`.                              |
| AskUserQuestion, `context: fork`                                        | Not used                                                                                                                                                           |

The two passes always run sequentially, so the skill never needs more than one extra subagent at a time.

## Arguments

Parse from `$ARGUMENTS`:

| Argument                 | Meaning                                                                                                       |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<pr-url>`               | Review a GitHub PR                                                                                            |
| `<diff-file>`            | Review a saved patch file                                                                                     |
| `--base <ref>`           | Review the working tree (committed + uncommitted) against the merge-base with `<ref>`                         |
| (none)                   | Same as `--base origin/<default-branch>`                                                                      |
| `--context <file\|text>` | Task context: issue body, acceptance criteria, PR description. A path is read; anything else is used verbatim |

## Phase 1 - Build the review assignment

Do not read the full diff into your own context; the subagents fetch it themselves. Resolve only what they need:

- **Local (`--base` or none):** resolve the default branch with `git symbolic-ref --short refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` (fallback `origin/main`). `BASE=$(git merge-base <ref> HEAD)`. Diff command: `git diff <BASE sha>`. Files: `git diff --name-only <BASE sha>`. Untracked files (`git ls-files --others --exclude-standard`) are not in the diff; list them separately so the subagents read them whole.
- **PR URL:** `gh pr view <url> --json number,headRefOid,baseRefName,title,body`. Diff command: `gh pr diff <url>`. If local `HEAD` is not `headRefOid`, run `git fetch origin pull/<number>/head` and tell the subagents to read changed files with `git show <headRefOid>:<path>` instead of the working tree. Use the PR title and body as context when `--context` is absent.
- **Diff file:** diff command `cat <file>`; files from its `+++ b/` headers.

If the file list is empty, output `Review Verdict: CLEAN` followed by `Nothing to review: empty diff.` and stop.

Assemble one **Review assignment** block, reused verbatim in both phases:

```
Repository: <absolute repo root>
Diff command: <command>
File reads: <working tree | git show <sha>:<path>>
Changed files:
<one per line>
Untracked files (new, read whole):
<one per line, or "none">
Task context:
<context, or "none">
```

## Spawning a clean-context subagent

Each pass is one fresh subagent whose prompt is the Review assignment plus the pass-specific payload. When the subagent is generic rather than a named adversary agent, prepend the full content of the pass's mandate file. Pass nothing else - not your own reading of the code, not hypotheses, not this conversation.

**Claude Code.** Use the Agent tool with the named agent type given in each phase; its mandate is already the agent's system prompt. If the type is unknown (plugin loaded without agent registration), retry with `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` and the mandate prepended.

**Codex.** Use the native agent tools only (`spawn_agent` / `wait_agent` / `close_agent`); never nested `codex exec` or shell-based agent probing.

- `spawn_agent` with the default agent type and the prompt as the message. Do not fork or inherit the parent conversation; if the tool offers a context-forking option, leave it off.
- `wait_agent` until it finishes, then `close_agent` immediately - completed agents do not free their thread slot until closed ([openai/codex#22779](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/22779)).
- Agents can finish without returning a payload ([openai/codex#16051](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/16051)). Validate the reply (below) before using it.

**opencode.** Use the `task` tool. Each call creates a fresh child session, which is the clean context this skill needs.

- If a `code-adversary` / `findings-adversary` subagent is installed (see the plugin README), use it and pass the Review assignment plus payload; the mandate is already its system prompt.
- Otherwise use the built-in `general` subagent with the mandate prepended.

**Copilot CLI.** The plugin registers the same named agents (`adversarial-review:code-adversary`, `adversarial-review:findings-adversary`); use them through its subagent tool when offered, otherwise a fresh generic subagent with the mandate prepended.

**Other agents** with a subagent tool: spawn a fresh generic subagent with the mandate prepended. Without a subagent tool, report `Review Verdict: BLOCKED`.

**Validation and retry.** If a reply is empty or lacks its required final verdict line, spawn a fresh subagent once more. If that fails too, report `Review Verdict: BLOCKED` with the reason.

## Phase 2 - Code Adversary

Spawn per [Spawning a clean-context subagent](#spawning-a-clean-context-subagent): named agent `adversarial-review:code-adversary`, mandate [references/code-adversary.md](references/code-adversary.md), payload _"Find the bug in this change and prove it. Read only; do not modify files."_

The reply must end with a `CODE_ADVERSARY_VERDICT:` line. Continue to Phase 3 even when it reports `CLEAN` with no findings.

## Phase 3 - Findings Adversary

Spawn a **new** subagent - never resume, message, or reuse the Code Adversary: named agent `adversarial-review:findings-adversary`, mandate [references/findings-adversary.md](references/findings-adversary.md), payload `Findings to refute:` followed by **only** the numbered `F<n>` finding blocks (label, message, location) copied from Phase 2. Use an empty findings list when Phase 2 is clean. Strip every other line of the Code Adversary's reply - the clean context is the point.

The reply must have one verdict line per input finding and end with a `FINDINGS_ADVERSARY_VERDICT:` line.

## Phase 4 - Apply verdicts

- UPHOLD → keep, mark high-confidence.
- DOWNGRADE / REWORD → replace with the corrected finding.
- REMOVE → drop; count it.
- Every `E<n>` escaped bug → a new finding in the output, tagged `(escaped)`. An `ESCAPED_BUG` verdict with no escaped finding in your output means you dropped one - go back and add it.
- Merge duplicates the adversary named.

## Output

The verdict comes **first**, on its own line - callers match the first line:

```
Review Verdict: CLEAN
```

or

```
Review Verdict: NEEDS_FIXES
```

- **CLEAN** - no surviving `blocking:` or `issue:`. Suggestions and questions alone stay CLEAN.
- **NEEDS_FIXES** - at least one surviving `blocking:` or `issue:`.

Then the surviving findings, strongest first, in conventional-comment format, high-confidence ones tagged `(verified)`:

```
**{label}:** {message}
*Location:* `{path/to/file}:{line}`
```

End with one line: `Adversaries: code <CODE_ADVERSARY_VERDICT> · findings <FINDINGS_ADVERSARY_VERDICT> · removed <N> · downgraded <N>`. Nothing after it. The findings verdict grades the findings, not the code - the `Review Verdict:` line is computed from the surviving findings alone.

## Anti-patterns

- Passing the Code Adversary's reasoning to the Findings Adversary - it then shares the same blind spot
- Reusing one subagent for both passes, or forking the parent conversation into either
- Padding a clean review - CLEAN is a real, useful verdict
- Reviewing architecture, naming, or dead code - wrong skill, use `/staff-code-review`
- Any prose above the `Review Verdict:` line

## Example invocations

In Codex use `$adversarial-review` in place of `/adversarial-review`.

/adversarial-review --base origin/release-1.4
/adversarial-review https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123
